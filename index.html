      <p><span>A</span> year after the pandemic put international travel on pause, higher vaccination rates has some countries easing travel restrictions.</p>

      <p>But rules and regulations vary from country to country, so travelers should familiarize themselves with COVID travel protocols before booking their next trip.</p>

      <p>Generally, travelers must be fully vaccinated, which is defined as two weeks following the last required does. But some places allow travel the same day as a second shot.</p>

      <p>If you aren’t yet fully immunized, you can still travel many places within the U.S. You can even book trips to Mexico and other countries where Americans are allowed to enter regardless of vaccination status, those in most cases travelers
        must provide proof of negative COVID test results.</p>
      <p>Below are the countries currently welcoming vaccinated Americans.</p>

          <p>As of April 12, vaccinated travelers who had their final dose at least 21 days prior to arrival only need to stay in place for 7 days (reduced from 14). They’ll still need to submit a test result 3 to 5 days before arrival and undergo a
            second test on arrival.</p>
          <p>The entry application fee for fully vaccinated visitors staying under 90 days in a hotel or villa is $300, as opposed to $600 for unvaccinated travelers staying in an approved private dwelling. From July 1, Anguilla is removing the fee
            and quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated visitors. The entry protocols will be revised and eventually eliminated by October 1. Anguilla’s tourist board has more information on the <a

          <p>Fully vaccinated Bahamian citizens and residents have been exempt from testing requirements as of April 21. All travelers—both vaccinated and unvaccinated—are being asked to follow government-mandated face mask requirements and

          <p>Fully vaccinated travelers (who have had the AstraZeneca, Pfizer, or Johnson & Johnson shots) can travel to Barbados with a shorter quarantine as of May 8. They’ll still need to provide a negative PCR test result three days prior to

            Moderna, Pfizer, or AstraZeneca—or one shot of a single-dose vaccine like Johnson & Johnson. Unvaccinated travelers will still be required to quarantine for a full four days after arriving, in addition to the two PCR tests. The BVI
