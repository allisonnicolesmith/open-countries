          <p>Fully vaccinated travelers (who have had the AstraZeneca, Pfizer, or Johnson & Johnson shots) can travel to Barbados with a shorter quarantine as of May 8. They’ll still need to provide a negative PCR test result three days prior to
            travel, as well as a vaccination certificate, have a test done at the airport, and then quarantine for one to two days. Unvaccinated travelers must quarantine for five to seven days and can’t leave their rooms at approved accommodations
            until their second negative PCR test result. Visit Barbados has all the latest <a href="https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020">COVID travel guidelines.</a></p>
